# RegistrationForm

<h1>Objectives</h1>

<ul>Practice recreating the staple of many websites, a <i>Registration Form</i></ul>
<ul>Practice using <b>form</b>, <b>input</b>, <b>select</b> and <b>textarea</b></ul>

<p>&emsp;Now that we've learned about all of the different types of form tags, let's create a registration form using only HTML. When registering for many websites, whether it's for an email account, a social media platform, or even this bootcamp, you are submitting a form! You will be using lots and lots of forms over the next few months to send data to your back-end so let's get comfortable creating some forms.</p>
